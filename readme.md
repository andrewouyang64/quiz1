## Coding Quiz##

-- The quiz page is designed according to the assignment criterias.

-- The style can be better if I have more time to add some more attributes
to those created elements in js.

-- A better way is possible by using jQUERY or Boostrap, but only
fucusing on using java script.

-- During the test, a few very interesting problems occurred. The codes
could run without problem didn't run properly after sometimes. After shut
down my labtop, then trying again, it worked again. Looked up to the internet
but couldn't find any answer.
